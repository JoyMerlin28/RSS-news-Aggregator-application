News Aggregator application

The News Aggregator application is designed to collect news articles from various RSS feeds, categorize them into predefined categories, and store them in a PostgreSQL database, providing users with an organized platform to access news based on their interests. It operates with a modular architecture consisting of key components: an RSS Feed Collector, a PostgreSQL database for structured data storage, and a RESTful API built using Flask for easy interaction with the stored articles. The application utilizes technologies such as Python for the programming language, Flask as the web framework, Celery for background tasks, Redis as the message broker, PostgreSQL as the database, and SQLAlchemy for database interactions. Installation involves cloning the repository, setting up a virtual environment, and installing required packages. Configuration includes setting up the database connection string and ensuring Redis is running locally. Once installed, the application allows users to start a Celery worker to handle background tasks and a Flask application to access the API, which can be tested using tools like Postman. The database schema includes an Articles table with columns for the article's ID, title, link, publication date, category, and feed source, along with a Categories table that stores the predefined categories. Example RSS feeds for the application include popular sources such as BBC News, CNN, and Reuters. Predefined categories encompass topics like Terrorism, Positive/Uplifting news, Natural Disasters, and Others, enabling users to filter articles by their interests. The API offers several endpoints, including one to retrieve all articles, another to filter articles by category, and a POST endpoint for adding new articles, complete with a request body specifying article details. The application incorporates error handling mechanisms for various issues such as database connection errors, invalid RSS feed formats, and network errors during feed fetching, ensuring robust performance. Future improvements could involve implementing user authentication for the API, allowing users to suggest new categories, adding a user interface for visualizing articles, and enhancing error handling and logging. This application aims to serve as a comprehensive solution for news aggregation, enabling users to access a curated selection of articles that align with their interests, making it easier to stay informed about current events while providing a scalable foundation for further enhancements and features. Overall, the News Aggregator represents an effective use of modern technology to streamline the process of collecting and categorizing news articles from multiple sources, thereby facilitating better access to information for users in a structured and organized manner.
